            <p>Forgive me I'm disturbing you again. I Apologize to all because I'm the idiot you maintained a friend relationship but i didn't realize, I took over advantage at you.</p>
            <p>The main reason why I reacted like that is because I don't know how to approach a girl, I don't know how girls interact, and u're the first girl I spoke closely. but I talked one girl in college she's friendly type she is speaks all boys in class also me if she'll ask me reading haa??, writing haa??, M chestunav I'll say yes, nothing. if she ask somthing else I say nothing, don't know that's it.</p>
            <p>That's why I felt different on you I didn't know what's it so that's why I reacted like that. please understand that my action were not a reflection of who I am as a person.</p>
            <p>I'm not saying to justify myself. so plz don't judge me & don't think badly about my character; I'm not like that person. I know I behaved foolishly and I'm really ashamed of myself.</p>
            <p>If I was irritated, disturbed or forced you Forgive me.</p>
            <p>Regardless of your response, I want you to know that I respect your boundaries and Will not reach out to you again without your permission.</p>
